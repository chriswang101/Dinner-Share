# Dinner-Share
AirBnb for Dinners: Created for SLO Hacks 2018

## About this Project
Dinner Share connects students to hosts who are willing to make a home-cooked meal. In addition, given the commitment of preparing meals, Dinner Share has a catering option for hosts who have extra food, ensuring that hosts do not lose money whatsoever.
